Notes
	
This page Links directly to the Product Engineering page for Installing MSSQL 2012 into a Microsoft Cluster. If any changes are required to the process please engage Application Product Engineering to have updates included.
	TAKE NOTE!
Service Account names, cluster names, or other domain object names listed in the below instructions are examples only. You must validate the names being created/requested are unique to the cluster in the domain and not already in use by another cluster in the customer solution.
MSSQL 2012 cluster requirements:
Create Failover Cluster
MSSQL 2012 Installation in a Failover Cluster
Pre-installation prep work:
Install SQL instance on the first (primary) node:
Install SQL instance on an additional (passive) node:
If required: Install additional SQL instance on the first (primary) node:
If required: Install additional SQL instance on an additional (passive) node:
MSSQL 2012 cluster requirements:
Supported OSes:
Windows Server 2008 SP2 Enterprise Edition
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Enterprise Edition
Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter Edition
Supported MSSQL editions:
MSSQL 2012 Standard Edition (2-node cluster maximum)
MSSQL 2012 Enterprise Edition
Storage:
System drive: A node's first SQL 2012 instance requires a bare minimum of  5600 MB; at least 1100 MB for each additional instance.  
If the cluster hasn't yet been created, the cluster will require 1 shared "Quorum" LUN, 1 GB
Each SQL instance on the cluster requires either:
1 or more LUNs, 50 GB or more dedicated to the instance.
A clustered Windows 2012 file server CIFS/SMB share.  Must be on the same subnet and NIC teamed across 2 DAS switches.
Network:
Each SQL instance on the cluster requires 1 or more IPs.
Create Failover Cluster
For the sake of modularity and to stay within the scope of this document, here is a link to the Failover Cluster build document:

Windows 2008 or 2008 R2:
https://confluence.savvis.net/x/TAFIAg
Windows 2012:
https://confluence.savvis.net/x/AtwyB
MSSQL 2012 Installation in a Failover Cluster
Pre-installation prep work:
	Windows 2008 (non-R2 only) Requirement:
MSSQL 2012 requires that Powershell 2.0 already be installed on the servers. 2.0 exists by default in Windows 2008 R2, but for Windows 2008 always verify Powershell 2.0 is installed on all cluster nodes before proceeding!

How to verify Powershell 2.0 is installed for Windows 2008: Open a powershell prompt and run get-host
Using the following link, install/remediate the MSSQL 2012 HPSA Software Policy on all cluster nodes.
https://confluence.savvis.net/x/EIdzAw
Create a domain group (global security group) under the customer's Users OU for the SQL Service Accounts named <SiteID><DataCenterID>SQLCLU_SG (ex. s123456sl7sqlclu_sg)
Create a domain account for the SQL service under the customer's Users OU named: <SiteID><DataCenterID>SQL<##> (ex. s123456sl7sql01) and set the password to "Never Expire".
If this account is on the *.msmps.net domain add this account to the customer's <SiteID>_UsersGroup group.
Add the account created in step 3 to the group created in step 2, and make it the "Primary Group".  Remove all other group memberships except <SiteID>_UsersGroup if applicable.
Add the group created in step 2 (ex: s123456sl7sqlclu_sg)  to the local Administrators group of each cluster node.
If these cluster nodes are on the *.msmps.net domain the following must be completed (otherwise skip): 
Create a computer account for the SQL VIP (Network Name) named <SiteID><DataCenterID>sql<##> (example: s123456sl7sql01) in the customer's <dc#>/computers sub-OU (ex: Managed Hosting > Customers > S123456 > SL7)
Add this new computer account to the <SiteID>_ComputersGroup.
Enable "Advanced Features" of Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC). To enable, go to View & select "Advanced Features".
Right-click the new SQL VIP computer account and select Properties.
In the "Security" tab give the cluster computer account (auto-created during cluster creation (ex: s123456sl7clu01) full control of the new SQL VIP computer account.
Important: Without this computer account and permission, the SQL Network Name will not start and the SQL Agent resource will not be created.
Install SQL instance on the first (primary) node:
Login to the first node as a Domain Admin account on the domain of which the server is a member.
Launch C:\xfer\MSSQL2012\setup.exe
On the "SQL Server Installation Center" window click "Installation" in the left pane.
Select "New SQL Server failover cluster installation" in the right pane.
Minimize the "SQL Server Installation Center" window.
Setup Support Rules: Wait for the checks to complete then click "OK".  If there are failures or warnings you will need to resolve these issues before proceeding.
Product Key: The product key will determine which edition is installed (Web, Std, Ent).  The installer package defaults to the Enterprise Edition product key (ends in 8H). To choose an edition other than Enterprise, enter one of the other product keys stored in the Internal password repository of password.savvis.net under "mssql-keys".  Click Next.
License Terms: Check "I accept the license terms", un-check "Send feature usage data to Microsoft..." and click Next.
"Install Setup Files" should automatically install the setup files and proceed to the next module without user action.
